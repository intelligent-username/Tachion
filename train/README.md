# Train

This folder contains the training scripts & configs. Preconditions are assumed!

We'll train an **XGBoost** model for predicting interest rate hikes/cuts, and a **DeepAR** models for everything else.

Note that the predictions for commodities won't be as strong, as they're affected by factors that aren't directly numeric, as discussed in the `data` folder [README](../data/README.md).

## File Structure

This folder contains the following important files:

```bash
├── deep.py           # DeepAR model definition
├── xg.py             # XGBoost model definition
├── train_deepar.py   # Script for training DeepAR models
└── train_xgboost.py  # Script for training XGBoost models
```

## Miscellaneous Notes

### DeepAR

DeepAR uses "a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an auto-regressive LSTM-based recurrent network model on a large number of related time series" (Salinas et al., 2017). DeepAR uses negative-log likelihood for predictions and makes predictions in the form of Monte Carlo samples for computing quantile estaimtes. It also doesn't require much feature engineering, as the RNN is able to learn temporal patterns on its own. The RNN is also able to learn seasonal trends, which is especially helpful for something like crytpocurrencies.

Once the DeepAR model is trained, when making inferences, we don't actually need as long of a history window as we do for training. For example, we could just go with the past 10 days instead of the past 5 years. This'll speed up inferences significantly.

### XGBoost

We'll be using Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, since hikes/cuts are much rarer than holds.

## Outputs

- Training scripts:
  - Import features generated by `core/features.py`
  - Align targets for the chosen prediction horizon
  - Fit interest rates / models using XGBoost with quantile loss
    - SMOTE to handle class imbalance (since usually we hold rates steady)
  - Save trained artifacts in `models/`

All scripts are designed to be reusable across assets and quantiles.

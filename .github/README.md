Tachion is a tool for forecasting market behaviour using historical market data. Currently, it supports:

- Stocks  
- Crypto  
- Forex  
- Commodities (gold, silver, oil)  
- Interest rate hike/cut probabilities  

Tachion provides point predictions and approximate 95% confidence intervals, enabling users to decide whether or not it's a good time to buy or sell.

## Features

- Predict next-period returns or price levels for multiple asset classes  
- Quantile-based predictions to estimate confidence intervals  
- Supports CSV ingestion for historical data  
- Lightweight, extensible Python backend  
- Interactive visualization for historical and predicted values  

## Prediction Mechanism

A different model will be trained for each class. For equities, cryptocurrencies, and commodities, we will use DeepAR (an RNN-based model) to predict the next-period log return based on historical OHLCV data and engineered features. For FOREX, we will use a similar architecture but with more macroeconomic features engineered in. For interest rate hike/cut probabilities, XGBoost will be used to classify the likelihood of a rate change based on historical data and economic indicators.

### DeepAR Explained

DeepAR is an autoregressive recurrent neural network architecture developed by Amazon for probabilistic time series forecasting. It learns patterns across multiple related time series simultaneously, generating not just point predictions but full probability distributions.

Once the learning is done, DeepAR would have generated a statistical distribution that best fits the simulations. We pick the statistical distribution to fit to beforehand, in this case, student's t-distribution, which is well-suited for financial returns due to its heavy tails. During inference, we just do some math based on the parameters of this distribution to get the desired quantiles (2.5th, 50th, 97.5th percentiles). Note, if the distribution doesn't fit well, we can always change it. If the math is "hard" to do, we can always just sample instead (or maybe even not even make a distribution but just plot a histogram directly and get quantiles from that).

This allows Tachion to provide confidence intervals alongside predictions, giving users a sense of uncertainty in the forecast.

See [this repository](https://github.com/intelligent-username/RNN) for more on RNNs and their implementation.

### XGBoost Explained

When it comes to interest rate predictions, we're no longer predicting continuous values, but categorical ones (hike/cut/hold). This requires us to perform classification instad of regression. There are many algorithms for classification. For this project, we'll go with XGBoost.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a highly efficient gradient boosting framework that excels at classification tasks. For interest rate predictions, it leverages economic indicators and historical patterns to classify the probability of rate hikes, cuts, or holds. Its ensemble of decision trees captures complex non-linear relationships in macroeconomic data. This, in turn, allows for decently robust predictions (as the Fed, in theory, is supposed to make data-driven decisions). However, it will require a lot of much feature engineering to get right.

See [this writeup](https://github.com/intelligent-username/Classification) for more on classification algorithms and XGBoost.

## Usage

The chief way to use Tachion is to go to [tachion.varak.dev](https://tachion.varak.dev) and use the hosted version.

### Running Locally

To run the project locally, follow the brief instructions below. For detailed configuration and architecture, please refer to the READMEs in the respective subdirectories.

#### 1. Backend (API)
Powered by FastAPI. Handles model inference and data serving.
```bash
# From project root
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```
*See [api/README.md](./api/README.md) for endpoint details.*

#### 2. Frontend
Built with React, Vite, and Bun.
```bash
# From project root
cd frontend
bun install
bun dev
```
*See [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md) for UI structure.*

#### 3. Training
Scripts for retraining models on processed data.
```bash
# From project root (using the 'tachion' venv)

# Train DeepAR/TFT (e.g., DeepAR on Forex)
python -m train.train_deep forex deepar -n

# Train XGBoost (Interest Rates)
python -m train.train_xgboost
```
*See [train/README.md](./train/README.md) for model arguments and options.*
